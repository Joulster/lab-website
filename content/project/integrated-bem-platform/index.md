An NUS project in collaboration with [Professor Yan Da (Tsinghua University)](http://www.arch.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/Building%20Science%20and%20Technology/1818) funded by the [Ng Teng Fong Charitable Foundation (NTFCF)](https://www.ntfcf.org.hk/our-initiase/) research funding

Building energy simulation is increasingly used beyond the design phase for code compliance, retrofit analysis, measurement and verification (M&V), as well as operations and controls. However, current modelling process is filled with redundancies. Models used to perform and evaluate parametric design strategies (during the design phase) are typically not the same models that are used for M&V or for subsequent retrofit analysis. Updating models and calibrating them with sensor data is also filled with redundancies because these information and models are typically not shared. As a result, there is often a need to re-map sensor data, recalibrate and re-update the design energy models, as well as re-analyse model outputs, all of which are challenging time-consuming tasks with high engineering cost. 

Combined with tools for automated calibration, model visualization and data analysis, if energy models and the relevant data can be shared, efforts needed to create, calibrate, and analyze energy models would be greatly reduced. The idea is to convert the idea of "big data" to "open data" to provide opportunities for innovation and collaborations between the two universities. Data sharing also provides an opportunity to scale-up current energy modeling technologies to the city-scale, further supplementing efforts to create a virtual campus and subsequently a virtual city.

The objectives of this research project are:
<ul>
 <li>Develop a platform that allows seamless integrtion and information exchange between building energy simulation and real-time data from the building's building automation system (BAS) and to promote "open data", scaling up opportunities and the potential of using energy simulation in various applications such as chiller optimization.</li>
 <li>Investigate the practical implementation of a schema for mapping data from the building automation systems to building energy models, a crucial step before using any data for building energy simulation.</li>
 <li>Implement an automated calibration framework so that calibration can be easily carried out.</li>
</ul>
