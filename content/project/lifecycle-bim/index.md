An NUS project funded by the Republic of Singapore’s National Research Foundation (NRF) through Building and Construction Authority (BCA)'s Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) R\&D Grant, and in collaboration with [BuildSimHub](https://www.buildsim.io)

The aim of this project is the development of a practical Building Information Model (BIM) to Building Energy Model (BEM) framework by bridging information and operation gaps in the current BIM to BEM process. 

As part of the project, an [open-source gbXML to EnergyPlus IDF translator](https://github.com/ideas-lab-nus/gbEplus) that provides a flexible plug-in interface through XML modules to provide a gateway to specify inputs to gbXML file during run-time. Continuous [Bayesian calibration](https://github.com/ideas-lab-nus/bc-stan) using BIM and energy data also is used to reduce the effort needed to maintain the energy model while accounting for its uncertainty. Invariably, the model would be up-to-date for use in applications such as retrofit analysis, fault detection, and model predictive control.
