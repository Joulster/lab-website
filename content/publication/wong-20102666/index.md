abstract = "Singapore experiences a hot and humid climate throughout the year. This in turn results in heavy reliance on mechanical systems especially air-conditioning to achieve thermal comfort. An alternative would be the use of evaporative cooling which is less energy intensive. Objective and subjective measurements were conducted at an experimental setup at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to evaluate the thermal conditions and thermal sensations brought about by misting fans. Field measurements were also conducted at food centres in Singapore to determine if they are coherent with the objective and subjective measurements conducted. Analysis of objective and subjective data showed that the misting fan was able to significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature and thermal sensation votes. This is consistent with field measurements taken, where regression analysis showed that with the misting fan, thermal neutrality can be obtained at a higher outdoor effective temperature (ET*). However, the reduction in temperature comes at the expense of higher relative humidity which results in consistently greater biological (bacterial and fungal) pollutants being enumerated from samples collected under the misting fan system. In some samples, the bacteria count is very much greater than samples collected under the non-misting fan, illustrating the potential for a substantial increase in biological pollutants due to the generation of mists."
