As a result, today’s models are getting increasingly complex and detailed. Consequently, for the simulation to be reliable, a large amount of data or information required, which is often impossible or impractical in reality. For the practitioner to progress, assumptions must be made about the missing information, introducing uncertainties into the model. Although it is important to reduce this uncertainty to zero, it is important that different sources of uncertainties are identified and accounted for so that risks are considered when using these models in the decision-making process. Currently, there is no building simulation study, framework or tool that allows an ad hoc approach to the quantification of the effects of uncertainty in chillers, despite methods existing in theory to provide a structure for a detailed uncertainty analysis and quantification. Combined with an automated calibration approach, the model is updated with building specific measured data and fine-tuned so that the model produces outputs that closely matches the actual building system.

The ability to import data from BIM and BEMS provides the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort needed for the continuous calibration of BES models. First, five gbXML geometric test cases were used to check the BIM to BES model translation. Translation of the test cases indicates good geometric agreement between the native BIM and the gbXML-based BES model. An actual building calibration case study (with BIM and three years of monthly electrical energy consumption data) was then used to evaluate the proposed continuous calibration method. The results suggest that compared to a non-continuous approach, the continuous Bayesian calibration method showed reduced prediction uncertainty and improved prediction accuracy on a test dataset. The paper also presents information and comparison of the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) and the normalized mean biased error (NMBE), recommending looking at their distributions when working with probabilistic BES predictions.","tags":["Energy simulation","Continuous calibration","Bayesian calibration","Uncertainty analysis","Building information models (BIM)","Green building XML (gbXML)"],"title":"Continuous-time Bayesian calibration of energy models using BIM and energy data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536422400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An NUS project in collaboration with Professor Godfried Augenbroe (Georgia Institute of Technology).\nWith increasing push from the Singapore Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to have buildings in Singapore certified environmentally friendly according to the Green Mark Scheme, there is an urgent need to verify that these “green buildings” are as environmentally friendly as they are purported. In particular, there is an opportunity for measurement and verification (M\u0026amp;V) using building energy models (BEMs) since these models are already required by the Green Mark Scheme to demonstrate the building\u0026rsquo;s energy savings. However, to date, there is no protocol for M\u0026amp;V using BEMs. Standards and guidelines are also vague with respect to model inputs, outputs, data resolution, as well as model fidelity. Moreover, a cost/benefit analysis of the gathering and processing of building data is missing in the current literature. The aim of this study is therefore to provide answers to the question “How much information should be gathered in the process of M\u0026amp;V, to reach a desired level of confidence in the resulting building energy model”. The answers will provide guidance on M\u0026amp;V protocols that lead to certified BEMs.\nTo ensure model reliability, an integral part of the M\u0026amp;V process is the calibration of the energy model. However, current BEM calibration has been carried out on an ad hoc basis, with most studies focusing on the automation of the calibration process, using deviation between predicted and measured outcomes as a measure of how ``well calibrated\u0026rdquo; the model is. One caveat is that the “calibrated” BEM may not be representative of the actual building performance since various combinations of inputs can produce a small deviation between measured and predicted outcomes. As a result, models calibrated using this approach might be non-identifiable due to over-parameterization, a problem typically neglected in studies that involve BEM calibration. Therefore, an important aspect of this research project is to investigate possible non-identifiability issues in BEM calibration. We hypothesize that low fidelity models can be better calibrated with limited data because they are less likely to be over-parameterized as compared to high fidelity models that typically contain hundreds if not thousands of uncertain or unknown parameters.\n","date":1530374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530374400,"objectID":"d07f76dd85f0989319d26c03ce5c6c2d","permalink":"/project/bem-measurement-verification/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/bem-measurement-verification/","section":"project","summary":"How much information should be gathered in the process of M\u0026V, to reach a desired level of confidence in the resulting building energy model.

However, current modelling process is filled with redundancies. Models used to perform and evaluate parametric design strategies (during the design phase) are typically not the same models that are used for M\u0026amp;V or for subsequent retrofit analysis. Updating models and calibrating them with sensor data is also filled with redundancies because these information and models are typically not shared. As a result, there is often a need to re-map sensor data, recalibrate and re-update the design energy models, as well as re-analyse model outputs, all of which are challenging time-consuming tasks with high engineering cost.\nCombined with tools for automated calibration, model visualization and data analysis, if energy models and the relevant data can be shared, efforts needed to create, calibrate, and analyze energy models would be greatly reduced. The idea is to convert the idea of \u0026ldquo;big data\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo; to provide opportunities for innovation and collaborations between the two universities.

Urban materials absorb solar and infrared radiation and the accumulated heat is dissipated in the atmosphere increasing further the air temperature. Roofs are envelope components which with advanced solutions such as cool roofs or green roofs can provide significant energy savings in air-conditioned buildings and improved indoor thermal conditions. By means of dynamic simulations in EnergyPlus software a numerical comparative analysis between these two solutions was done in a tropical climate like Singapore’s, taking into account climatological, thermal, optical and hydrological variables. Simulations of a typical summer day in Singapore were assessed to determine (i) UHI reductions for different green/cool roof scenarios; (ii) the diurnal heat fluxes dynamics and (iii) the buildings’ thermal energy reduction for the investigated cases. The results show that during peak periods (9 am to 5 pm) cool roofs reduce heat gain by about 0.14 KWh/m2 (8%) and green roofs mitigate considerably less to about 0.008 KWh/m2 (0.4%). And for the whole of a summer design day, cool and green roof reduces heat gain by 15.53 (37%) and 13.14 (31%) KWh/m2 respectively. The numerical simulation results confirm that an appropriate selection of roof materials contribute to the reduction of the negative effects of UHI but experimental data for air-conditioned buildings are yet to be carried out.","tags":["Green roof","Cool roof","Tropical climate","Energy efficiency","Mitigation potential"],"title":"Green and cool roofs’ urban heat island mitigation potential in tropical climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Kathrin Menberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514736000,"objectID":"23a0c2f63f7634f54684d7ffcdaabc3f","permalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2018527/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides practical guidelines to the Bayesian calibration of building energy models using the probabilistic programming language Stan.

Using a case study, we demonstrate the application of Kennedy and O’Hagan’s (KOH) [1] Bayesian calibration framework to an EnergyPlus whole building energy model. The case study is used to analyze the sensitivity of the posterior distributions to the number of calibration parameters. The study also looks into the influence of prior specification on the resulting (1) posterior distributions; (2) calibrated predictions; and (3) model inadequacy that is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions. Results from the case study suggest that over-parameterization can result in a significant loss of posterior precision. Additionally, using strong prior information for the calibration parameters may dominate any influence from the data leading to poor posterior inference of the calibration parameters. Lastly, this study shows that it may be misleading to assume that the posteriors of the calibration parameters are representative of their true values and their associated uncertainty simply because the calibrated predictions matches the measured output well.","tags":["Bayesian calibration","Building energy modeling","Building simulation","Gaussian process","Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"],"title":"Guidelines for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"6a476c22afa1cb96b5f4a029efee8e1a","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017-comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A comparison of MCMC algorithms for the Bayesian calibration of building energy models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Matteo Pozzi","Junjing Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"1e91ce185661e0cc2cc2dd9864896edf","permalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2017343/","section":"publication","summary":"Bayesian calibration as proposed by Kennedy and O’Hagan [22] has been increasingly applied to building energy models due to its ability to account for the discrepancy between observed values and model predictions.

This study focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by: (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with Gelman–Rubin statistics Rˆ within 1±0.1.

However, when different retrofitting solutions are combined and applied to a building, the total energy savings potential, which is less than the sum of the savings from applying the various individual retrofitting solutions, is considerably reduced and the synergies among the various technologies need to be understood and evaluated. In this study, the concept of utilizability is employed for the analysis of multiple energy retrofitting solutions in buildings and is defined as the ratio of energy savings derived from applying combined solutions to a building over the sum of individual energy savings from applying individual solutions.

State-of-the-art technique that couples evolutionary algorithms with a building simulation engine, which is time consuming and often cannot reach the “true” optimal solutions. Studies addressing these issues focus on implementing strategies such as fine tuning optimization algorithm's parameters, hybrid evolutionary algorithms with a local search algorithm or optimizing meta-models. Unlike the previous studies, this paper proposes two improvement strategies for building system design optimization. The two strategies, adaptive operators approach and adaptive meta-model approach, modify the behaviors of conventional evolutionary algorithms to improve the optimization convergency and speed performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these two strategies compared to conventional algorithms, a case study was conducted. The case study observed high convergency performance from both strategies with 30% and 60% time savings respectively. Furthermore, this study examines the performance comparison in respect to convergency, diversity preservation and speed between these two strategies.","tags":["Multi-objective evolutionary optimization","Building system design","Building cost estimation","Optimization performance"],"title":"Improving evolutionary algorithm performance for integer type multi-objective building system design optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adrian Chong","Khee Poh Lam","Weili Xu","Omer T Karaguzel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451577600,"objectID":"5f4596895fc70fb4c1be45aacb50a198","permalink":"/publication/chong-2016-missing/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chong-2016-missing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Imputation of missing values in building sensor data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weili Xu","Khee Poh Lam","Adrian Chong","Omer T.

Coupled with the need to create and develop sustainable urban developments, it is essential to understand how much the environment as well as its surrounding morphology affects the built environment. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on urban planning which takes into consideration the surrounding environment and any accompanying effects it might have on the built environment. The integration of design tools with microclimate assessment tools therefore attest to be one with a promising future. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the building performance of offices in Singapore whilst taking into account its surrounding morphology using GIS as a platform for integration with an urban climatic assessment tool. Hourly weather data which accounts for the urban morphology (input to the model) is obtained by morphing maximum, minimum and average temperature (the output of air prediction model STEVE) into a typical 24h profile. Good agreement was found between predicted dry-bulb temperatures and measured data. A total of two indicators of envelope performance were used and they are (1) increase in conduction (wall, window and roof) heat gain and (2) solar heat gain through glazing taking into account shading by surrounding buildings and morphology. The model was shown to have good agreement with building energy simulation programme IES-VE.","tags":["Urban heat island","Building envelope performance","Window solar heat gain"],"title":"Predicting the envelope performance of commercial office buildings in Singapore","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

This in turn results in heavy reliance on mechanical systems especially air-conditioning to achieve thermal comfort. An alternative would be the use of evaporative cooling which is less energy intensive. Objective and subjective measurements were conducted at an experimental setup at the National University of Singapore (NUS) to evaluate the thermal conditions and thermal sensations brought about by misting fans. Field measurements were also conducted at food centres in Singapore to determine if they are coherent with the objective and subjective measurements conducted. Analysis of objective and subjective data showed that the misting fan was able to significantly reduce the dry-bulb temperature and thermal sensation votes. This is consistent with field measurements taken, where regression analysis showed that with the misting fan, thermal neutrality can be obtained at a higher outdoor effective temperature (ET*). However, the reduction in temperature comes at the expense of higher relative humidity which results in consistently greater biological (bacterial and fungal) pollutants being enumerated from samples collected under the misting fan system. In some samples, the bacteria count is very much greater than samples collected under the non-misting fan, illustrating the potential for a substantial increase in biological pollutants due to the generation of mists.","tags":["Misting fan","Evaporative cooling","Singapore","Hot","Humid"],"title":"Performance evaluation of misting fans in hot and humid climate","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
